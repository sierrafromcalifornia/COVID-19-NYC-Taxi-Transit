This project shows the effects of the Corona Virus on taxi transportation in NYC. 

## Problem

## Data

https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page
Taxi trip records from 4 market sources monthly across several years
Associated data dictionaries
Taxi zone lookups

## Methods & Results


## Conclusions

* What has been the economic impact of the pandemic on NYC taxi revenue over time?
* What was the most expensive trip? Between what zones? Conversely, what was the cheapest trip? What is the difference between these before and during the peak impact of the pandemic?
* What's the most popular payment method? Did this change because of the pandemic?
* What’s the most expensive day of the week to travel on? Did this change because of the pandemic?
